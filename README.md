# Predicting_Student_Performance_Project
Uncovering Insights for Student Performance using R


 Created a regression model to determine significant attributes to student performance and built classification models to predict studentâ€™s pass/fail rate with 71% accuracy. Data preparation, EDA, and feature selection is done before data modeling. Models include linear regression, neural network, decision trees (cart, c5.0, Naive Bayes). Model evaluation was done to compare the performance of all models. All models used outperformed the baseline model. Neural network resulted in the best model with an accuracy of 64% and specificity of 74.6%.
 
 
 The project code, paper, and data sets are included in this repository.
